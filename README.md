# Space Blast!
 
To access this game i have made, go to the link to download the contents, overall it is 1 GB in size:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ChtWWHYxau2M6B444SV0E2LSynd47U4l?usp=sharing

You need to create a new folder in File Explorer and put all of the contents from the link into that folder. Create a new issue with the tag 'Setup' if you need help.

This is my first proper game so there could be many improvements and other games to come!

# Want a new feature?
By all means, ask for a feature to be added, i have only got 10 levels AND I NEED MORE INSPIRATION!
To ask for a feature, create an issue with the tag 'Feature request'
