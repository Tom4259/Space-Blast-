# Space Blast!
 
To access this game i have made, go to the link to download the contents. This is the first time i have published the game onto GameJolt so i do not know my way around the site or if you have to create an account to download the contents.

You need to create a new folder in File Explorer and put all of the contents from the link into that folder. Create a new issue with the label 'Setup' if you need help.

This is my first proper game so there could be many improvements and other games to come!

# Want a new feature?
By all means, ask for a feature to be added, i have only got 10 levels AND I NEED MORE INSPIRATION!
To ask for a feature, create an issue with the label 'Feature request'

# Bug reporting
If you do encounter any bugs while playing, do make a new issue. I will try to fix it as soon as i can, re-build the project and make a new link, and notify you that i have fixed it.

# Known bugs:
